## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- pnpm (recommended; pnpm-lock.yaml included)

## Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Dev (landing page)

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Build (extension + landing page)

```bash
pnpm build
```

This build command removes the root client folder and copies the generated extension build from .svelte-kit/output/client to ./client.

## Load the extension in Chrome

1. Run the build command above.
2. Open Chrome and go to "Manage extensions".
3. Click "Load unpacked".
4. Select the buzz-frontend/client folder.

## Local API URL

To point the extension to a local backend (default http://localhost:9999), update API_URL in both places:

- static/api.js
- client/api.js

Example:

```js
const API_URL = 'http://localhost:9999';
```

Refresh the extension in Chrome after changes.

## Notes

- Edits in client require a manual extension refresh in Chrome. There is no live reload.
- The source of truth for extension assets is in static; client is generated by the build step.

## Chrome Web Store

Update manifest.json as needed, then follow the Web Store publishing guide:
